## Description

The world you know is fading, devoured by rust, decay, and time.  
Once-thriving civilizations now lie buried beneath dunes of corroded steel and forgotten ruins. Towering constructs from a bygone age stand silent, their gears jammed, their purposes lost to memory.

In this land of ruin, survival is both a battle and a burden.  

You are a survivor, a wanderer of the Rustlands. Each step brings you closer to the heart of the decay—a sprawling labyrinth of ancient chambers and forgotten vaults known as the Iron Maw.  
You are an adventurer, seeking answers, treasure, or perhaps redemption.  
Before you lies a series of rooms, each more treacherous than the last.  

Do you have what it takes to navigate the dangers, claim the treasure, and uncover the secrets of the Rust & Ruin?
